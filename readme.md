# üß™ 1mg Drug Info Scraper (Node.js - Educational Use Only)

This is a **headless, respectful web scraper** built using **Node.js** and **Selenium WebDriver**.

It fetches public drug pricing information from [1mg.com](https://www.1mg.com) by searching drugs listed in a local `input.json` file, and stores results into `output.json`.
